A big fan of the gedit color theme 'Twilight' by Will Farrington, I made a pretty literal translation of it for vim here ( I did borrow Yoshi Nima's excellent status bar coloring from his theme also named 'twilight'). The only changes from Farrington's scheme is that I did away with the 'dark maroon' guibg and added Pmenu colors.
